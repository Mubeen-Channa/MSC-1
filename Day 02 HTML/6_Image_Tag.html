<!-- Used to Add Image in the Page -->

<!-- The img tag in HTML is a self-closing tag, meaning it doesn't have a closing tag like </img>.
       It is used to add images in a web page.
       The "src" attribute specifies the URL of the image,
       while the "alt" attribute provides alternative text for the image,
       which is displayed if the image cannot be loaded 
-->


<img src="image.png" alt="Car Image">
    <!--  src & alt are attributes  -->
