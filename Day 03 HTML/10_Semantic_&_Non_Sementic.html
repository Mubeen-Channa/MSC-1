<!-- 
    1. Semantic Tags: Meaningful tags that clearly describe their purpose in the HTML document.
       -> h1, hr, header, footer, main, nav, article, section, aside
       
       header: Represents introductory content, typically a group of introductory or navigational aids.
       
       footer: Represents a footer for its nearest sectioning content or sectioning root element.
       
       main: Represents the dominant content of the body of a document.
       
       nav: Represents a section of a page that links to other pages or to parts within the page.
       
       article: Represents independent, self-contained content. Suitable for blog posts, forum posts, news articles, etc.
       
       section: Represents a generic section of a document, used for grouping together related content.
       
       aside: Represents content that is indirectly related to the main content. Often used as a sidebar in a document.

       
Advantage: Improves document structure, makes the content more understandable, and enhances SEO friendliness.



    2. Non-Semantic Tags: Tags that do not provide any information about the meaning or structure of the document content.
       -> div, span

       div: Used as a container for other HTML elements, typically used for styling or layout purposes.
       
       span: Used to group inline-elements in a document. Typically used for styling parts of the text.

       
Disadvantage: Do not convey any information about the content they contain, making them less useful for SEO and accessibility.
